# Visual Direction & Atmosphere

**Theme**: High Traditional Fantasy with a focus on Majesties, Mysteries, and Martial Might.

## 🎨 Core Pillars

### 1. Grandeur and Sacred Spaces
The game world should feel ancient and significant. 
- **The Sanctuary (Lobby)**: A mountain-top cathedral of white stone and gold leaf. God-rays, incense, and the sound of distant bells.
- **The Dungeons**: Even in dark places, there should be remnants of lost civilizations—overgrown ruins, bioluminescent caverns, and massive stone carvings.

### 2. Physicality and Weight
Everything has a physical presence. 
- **Combat**: Heavy swings, metallic clangs, and the sound of stone being crushed.
- **Interaction**: Selecting a mercenary at the **Roster Altar** is an act of spiritual attunement, accompanied by pillars of light and choral swells.
- **HUD**: Minimized and integrated. Use diegetic elements (like the **Tome of Whispers** for abilities) where possible.

### 3. Contrasting Light and Dark
- **Safe Zones (Hubs)**: Warm ambers, bright whites, and lush blues. A sense of peace and preparation.
- **Danger Zones (Missions)**: Inky shadows, flickering torchlight, and the cold glow of hostile magic. 

## 🎭 Visual Elements

| Element | Visual Style |
|---------|--------------|
| **Architecture** | Romanesque/Gothic stone, heavy oak, gold filigree. |
| **Magic** | Flowing elemental wisps, swirling nebulas, and prismatic light bursts. |
| **Characters** | Battle-hardened but noble. Gear looks used, detailed, and historically inspired but magically enhanced. |
| **Portals** | Massive stone gateways ("The Great Gate") opening into celestial voids. |

## 🎧 Soundscape
- **Hub**: Ethereal choirs, wind through stone arches, and the rhythmic ringing of bells.
- **Mission**: Low-frequency drones, the echo of footsteps on cold stone, and the sharp, sudden sound of combat engagement.

## 📜 Key References
- **Sanctuary of Valor**: The core vision for the pre-mission lobby.
- **High Fantasy Aesthetic**: Standard tropes (Elves, Dwarves, Humans) but with a "heavy/grounded" martial feel.
