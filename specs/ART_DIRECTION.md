# ⚔️ Visual Direction: The Fallen Splendor

**Theme**: A world of "Stained Gold and Rusted Iron." The setting shows clear signs of a forgotten, heroic age that has been scavenged and repurposed for a brutal, mercenary present.

## 🎨 Core Pillars

### 1. Decaying Splendor (The "Used" World)

The environment shows the skeletal remains of a high-fantasy era, now buried under grime and utility.

* **The Bastion (Lobby)**: A fortress built into the ruins of a once-massive cathedral. You see high, vaulted ceilings, but they are now choked with soot from blacksmith forges.
* **Visual Contrast**: Fine marble floors are cracked and patched with **rough timber planks**. Exquisite carvings on the walls have been partially chipped away to make room for iron weapon racks or torch brackets.

### 2. Scavenged Majesty

Nothing is "new." Everything is a relic being forced to serve a new, darker purpose.

* **The Roster Altar**: This was once the base of a heroic monument or a sacred font. Now, the statue is broken off at the ankles, and the flat stone surface is being used as a cluttered mercenary desk.
* **The Tome of Whispers**: This ancient, legendary book is now held together by crude leather straps and iron rivets to keep its decaying pages from falling out.


* **The Gear**: Mercenaries wear "mismatched" equipment. A soldier might have a beautifully engraved "heroic" pauldron paired with a rusted, functional iron breastplate.

### 3. The "Cold Fire" Atmosphere

The light in this world is "fighting" to stay alive.

* **Safe Zones**: The warm hearth-light is constantly competing with the cold, blue shadows of the ruins. Dust motes in the air shouldn't look like "magic sparkles," but like **ash and debris** floating in the light.
* **Color Palette**: Deep **Verdigris** (the green of aging bronze), **Faded Gold** (peeling and dull), and **Sooty Black**.

## 🎧 The Sound of Regression

* **The Hub**: The "echo" is key. A single hammer strike in the forge should echo through the ruins like a ghost of the past. The music should be "broken"—a grand orchestral theme played by only one or two gritty instruments (like a gravelly cello or a worn-out drum).
* **The World**: The sound of **crumbling stone** and the wind whistling through gaps in the ancient architecture.

> To achieve this in-engine, use **Decals** to add "grime," "leaks," and "cracks" over your clean stone textures. Use **Future Lighting** to ensure the shadows from the "broken" architecture feel heavy and oppressive.
